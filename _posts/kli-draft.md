### Spark
    RDD ( resilient distributed datasets)  An RDD is represented as a Scala object and can be created from a file; as a parallelized slice (spread across nodes); as a transformation of another RDD; and finally through changing the persistence of an existing RDD, such as requesting that it be cached in memory.
    Runs on top of Mesos.
